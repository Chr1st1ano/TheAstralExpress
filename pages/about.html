            The Astral Express is not just a mode of transportation â€” it's a lifestyle, a cafÃ©, and a journey through the stars. Founded by the Trailblazers, our mission is to bring comfort, coffee, and companionship to every corner of the universe.

            "Making a drink is a sensory skill. In dreams, creating fizzy concoctions requires adding a bit of your mood. Heavier if you're troubled, a touch sweeter if you're in high spirits... It's not just about mixing beverages. It's about mixing the experiences of life."
          </p>
          <p>
            Gallagher is a security officer of the Bloodhound Family at Penacony. He was also a slovenly and indolent mixologist. Though unorganized in apparel and casual in how he made his drinks, he was always courteous toward guests but kept his vigilance about him.
            <br /><br />
            He seemed to be a character with a complicated past, yet never actively mentioned any details. He was later revealed to be closely related to the "Death" that had arrived on Penacony, a "child" of The Watchmaker, and a Pathstrider of the Enigmata.
